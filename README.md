# NeurIPS-Polymer-Prediction

My solution to the NeurIPS 2025 Polymer Prediction [Kaggle Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/neurips-open-polymer-prediction-2025).

It consisted of a stacking ensemble of 3 (Graph Neural Networks) GNNs in an XGBoost meta-model. They consist of three GNNs, one with graph convolutional layers, the second with graph isomorphism layers, and the third with graph attention layers.
